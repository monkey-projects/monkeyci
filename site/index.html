      <p>
	Why are the scripts of all CI/CD pipelines always in Yaml?  Sure, it's handy
	to get a quick start.  But very soon you run into all sorts of issues.  A red
	flag is when you see an "if" in a Yaml key.  <i>Yikes!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
	With <b>MonkeyCI</b> you won't have to worry about that.  We provide a system
	that uses the full power of a programming language to set up your more complicated
	build pipelines.  You can still get started with Yaml script, but move on to a
	real language as the need arises.  And no, you won't have to learn a complicated
	syntax, because we're using one of the most <i>syntax-less</i> languages out there:

      </p>
      <p>
	We're still working on it, but as soon as it's ready to use, we'll let you know right here.
	In the meantime, you can already read some of <a href="https://www.monkey-projects.be/blog">our
